# KgatlhisoPholoholo-OffshoreDangerZoneProject
This interactive Streamlit app models hydrate formation risk in offshore pipelines by allowing users to adjust key parameters such as temperature, pressure, salinity, and water cut. As each value changes, the visualization updates in real time to show how those conditions affect hydrate formation probability. The goal is to make complex flow-assurance concepts easier to understand through visual, hands-on exploration.
